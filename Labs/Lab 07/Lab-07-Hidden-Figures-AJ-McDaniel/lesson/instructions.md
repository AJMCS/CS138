# Lab 7 - Hidden Figures  

_ Learning Objectives: Demonstrate understanding of string methods, such as replace, split, lstrip, upper, and join._

Most of us have used tools that manipulate paragraph contents when writing a paper. We wonder how the application does this. This lab will make some corrections to a paragraph that talks about the first African American computer programmer, Dorothy Vaughan. This paragraph has a few grammatical errors. Instead of having "were" it has "where" and every sentence's first word starts with a lower case. The purpose of this lab is to learn more about the first female programmer by practicing using some string methods.

 ## Step 1: Create a function that makes the corrections 
Write a function called *capitalizing_paragraph* that takes one parameter; string paragraph. The function should:

- Replace all the "where" with "were" and save it as a new string.
- Split the paragraph using a period "." and save the list.
- Remove all the leading white space from each element in the list.
- Replace the lower case with an upper case for the first element of the string.
- Create a string name period defined as ". ".
- Take the period and join it with every element on the list.
- Display the final string product.

Return the final string product.

## Step 2: Set up the main function
Display the correct content "Corrected paragraph. " + final string product by calling the *capitalizing_paragraph* and using the DOROTHY_HISTORY constant.

## Test ## 
Try out your function with different values to check that it is working correctly.
