# Unit 1 Programming Project #
## Goal: ##
_Create a Python program using Unit 1 topics to demonstrate knowledge and mastery._
## Requirements: ##
- Tie it to a real-world topic:
  - Should be linked to an article, podcast, video, etc.
OR 
  - A personal idea for something that is useful/fun for you, your community, etc.
- Must use materials from, and restricted to, topics we've covered so far: data/typecasting, console input, formatted output, functions. Specifically:
  - At least 5 data variables
  - At least 2 distinct function definitions per group member used in your program in a useful way
  - Demonstration of some sort of calculation or transformation of data
  - Console input used in a meaningful way
  - Formatted output used in a meaningful way

## Resources: ##
Textbook and Lecture Videos for examples, Python syntax rules, and strategy

Replit Labs for larger examples, getting inspiration or ideas

## Scoring Guide: ##
All group members might not recieve the same score. Be sure to indicate which parts of the project you contributed by inserting comments. You may also be asked to explain portions of the code so that I can distinguish your personal understanding of the material.

This assignment will be scored on the EARN scale, an A or E is needed for completion.

Exemplary (E): Everything for A plus code is well-documented and follows all course style conventions. This work could be used as a classroom example.

Acceptable (A): Understanding of the concepts is evident. Code compiles and runs without errors. All of the requirements are met.

Revision Needed (R): Partial understanding of the concepts is evident, but there are significant gaps. Further review and improvements required. Program does not run or not all requirements are met. See comments for suggested improvements.

Not Assessable (N): Not enough information is present in the work to determine whether there is understanding of the concepts.
